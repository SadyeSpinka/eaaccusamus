## Logging Commands

When you first see a Shiki Twoslash code sample with an inline compiler error, you instinctively trust that the compiler error is correct because the design shows that it is not a part of the code sample. The logging tools lets you do that, but abuses the systemic trust because your code is not being evaluated to generate the logs.

This feature is effectively a facade, people will trust your output and it will look better. 

### `@log:`, `@warn:`, `@error:`

The names are based on the functions on the `console` object:

```ts twoslash
console.log("Hello world")
// @log: Hello world

console.warn("Ola Mundo")
// @warn: Old  Mundo

console.error("Neih hou")
// @error: Neih hou
```
