## Highlight Code

There are many ways to help someone focus on the important part of a code sample. One of the most prominent tools for this is by highlighting a particular chunk of code.

#### Codefence Line Highlights

To highlight a particular set of lines, Shiki Twoslash re-used the [gatsby-remark-vscode's](https://github.com/andrewbranch/gatsby-remark-vscode#gatsby-remark-vscode) [syntax](https://github.com/andrewbranch/gatsby-remark-vscode#line-highlighting), which expands on the codefence string.

```ts twoslash {1,3-5}
const a = 1; // highlighted
const b = 2;
const c = 3; // highlighted
const d = 4; // highlighted
const e = 5; // highlighted
```

The line highlight syntax follows the convention of how your editor shows lines, which is starting at `1`, not `0`. You can have as many numbers and ranges as you'd like.

#### Inline Highlights

This is WIP, but there is support in the system for inline highlights via `// ^^^^^`

```ts twoslash
const hello = "world"
//    ^^^^^^^
```

The intention is that Shiki Twoslash would highlight just the words which are inside the hats. The line is removed, but there's no support in Shiki Twoslash for rendering them _yet_. ( Or maybe there is and I've not updated the docs, try it? )
